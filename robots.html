    <center> <h1>Robots</h1>

    <p style="font-family:Arial"> Robots aren’t a new concept by any means; the Egyptians created the earliest versions of a robot recorded in 1500 BCE, it was a water clock which used a container filled with water that would drip over time. The water measurement would have to be checked to tell the time, these developed over time and introduced gongs that would bang on the hour. The next significant development was invented by a Greek mathematician named Archytas, who had built a mechanical bird powered by steam (Robotics: A Brief History, 2020). George C. Devol created the first modern-style robot in the early 1950s. The first modern robot “Unimate” was designed to perform repetitive tasks. It was used in the car manufacturing industry for welding and to automate metalworking tasks (Unimate - ROBOTS: Your Guide to the World of Robotics, 2020) (Spaeth, 2020).
        <br>
        <br>
Since the big step into robotics in the modern world, they have changed and shaped everything we see and do today, without robots in our lives I do not believe we would not be as far advanced as a civilization as we are now as many of the tasks we used to perform manually now have robot counterparts which have taken these roles over freeing up investment time into new projects and inventions.
        <br>
        <br>
In 2012 NASA began work on a new robot called Valkyrie (formerly known as R5) which has been designed to operate in damaged human-engineered environments with the long term goal of creating a humanoid which will be able to assist with setting up new habitats in preparation for humans on Mars. Although in the early stages Valkyrie was initially designed to aid and assist with Disaster relief, this course was changed during development updating the long term function of her to outer space travel instead (Meet Valkyrie, NASA’s Space Robot - Sky & Telescope, 2020) (R5, 2020).
        <br>
Valkyrie is currently able to view and navigate through different terrains by itself, to plan and to make its way over rocky terrain as well as opening and closing objects. Still, outside of that, it doesn’t hold many of the capabilities that were planned for it when development had begun, Valkyrie is currently slow and inefficient but has become a great learning tool for improvements that will be able to be made with future iterations of humanoids. In the next three years, I think we will see this type of technology take massive leaps forward in the mobility and AI that makes the decisions.
The technological developments of robot mobility have been around for a while; Atlas is an excellent example of this. Atlas was created by Boston Dynamics and can quickly and swiftly traverse harsh, dense terrain. If NASA was able to use some of the technologies in use by Boston Dynamics keeping in mind the end goal of outer space travel, significant improvements might be able to be made to Valkyrie.
        <br>
        <br>
The impact of further developments to Valkyrie and other similar humanoid robots will have I believe will make a good fit in our current society whether they end up in roles that aid and assist humans performing manual labour jobs performing the hard lifting or taking on dangerous roles in places humans cannot get to or are unable to survive and work. In the same token, these humanoid robots could also be used in wars in aid and assist humans and be able to perform acts of great evil at the hands of their creators. Over the past 70 years, we’ve seen robots move into our lives and take over manual handling roles in factories; there is no way to know for sure who will be the most affected by the rise of humanoid robots as this impact will vary depending on what roles they are created for at the time. As robots gain the same abilities of humans, many jobs may become redundant for humans to complete as robots will have the capability to run 24 hours a day and therefore be much more efficient and cost-effective than humans.
        <br>
Over the next ten years, humanoid robots will become a very prevalent part of our society and in turn, will help us as a species to evolve further as they have done consistently since the ’50s.
        <br>
        <br>
As the technologies for robots age, develop and become more advanced and are inevitably become commercialized, most companies may begin to have a workforce of robots.
 As an individual, I will see robots in and around my workplace and possibly even in my home. Robots will take many of the tasks I find in the workplace and at home and be able to complete them for me. This will either make me a lazier person or a far more productive person than I currently am.
