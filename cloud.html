      <b>What does it do?</b>
      <br>
      <br>
Clouds, services and servers is a very broad term that refers to cloud computing. Simply put, cloud computing is using servers, databases, software, analytics, and storage over the internet (the cloud). This has a massive range of benefits. There are three main types of cloud computing, being Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS) and Software as a service (SaaS). Cloud computing means that you can pay for cloud services and software that you actually need and use on a subscription basis, rather than buying software packages outright that you only need a small portion of, for a short time period. Cloud computing in regards to IaaS means that businesses can move to cloud storage solutions (also known as off site storage solutions), which means removing  their on-site data centres, saving humongous amounts of electricity, all while saving a lot of money as well. This also means that these companies transitioning from having a data centre to using off-site storage in the way of cloud computing will not have to employ IT Staff to manage their storage systems, and will be able to have peace of mind that their data is secure in case anything happens to their office.  Some of these services include Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft Azure. Cloud computing also has enabled staff within businesses as well as consumers to work collaboratively together, with real time updates documents and programs. Consumers can also save precious documents and memories thanks to the advancements of cloud computer systems, to have peace of mind that their data is safe. This also means that companies don’t have to hire staff from where their headquarters are located; they can hire talent from anywhere in the world and have the staff member work remotely, over the cloud. Cloud computing is quite a developed industry already, although in the next couple of years it is likely that prices for consumers and businesses for cloud software and storage will continue to be driven down. There will also be new programs and collaboration tools developed, produced and commercialised. A good example of this is Zoom, a live video conferencing application. We will be seeing new companies with similar products to this, especially in the current climate we are in as a world. We will also likely see countless new cloud storage companies enter the market, competing with the existing companies for market share. The developments that continue to be made in hard drives and storage bays continue to make this possible. Bigger drives, less of a rate of failure, in conjunction with technology evolving so that cooling systems are more efficient are also developments that make this possible.

          <b>What is the likely impact?</b>
<br>
          <br>
There are a lot of impacts that cloud computing brings. One of the biggest ones and most important benefits for businesses especially is the cost involved. Cloud computing eliminates the need of buying expensive hardware and running on-site data centres. Another cost that cloud computing saves is the massive bill for power that the cooling systems use to cool these data centres. Businesses will also save money from various other things as well, including the fact that they will not need to hire staff to manage the hardware. This does mean that some jobs will be affected by this technology for the businesses using it, but other jobs will be created in the cloud companies. Another impact that this would have for businesses is speed and productivity, along with reliability. For consumers, this would mean a lot of things. One of the impacts of Cloud Computing is cheaper software, with instant, constant updates. Take services like Microsoft Office 365, or Google Drive. These are known as SaaS (Software as a service). 	<br>

          <b>How will this affect you?</b>
              <br>
              <br>
This will affect me as a consumer, as well as my friends and family a fair bit. On one hand of the scale, rather than having to buy expensive software outright, we can pay a yearly subscription or fee to use the software temporarily. This is great if we only need to use the particular program for a specific amount of time. Take Microsoft Office 365, or Google Drive, for example. Personally, I also use a service called “BackBlaze”. It is a service where you can pay $5 a month, and it will automatically backup your data from your computer every night and you can access the data anywhere, anytime, even from your phone. This is a great example of software and cloud computing put together. Another great example is Anti-Virus software, which as consumers, is classed as a necessity for protection. Cloud computing enables me to safely keep my data in the cloud. Personally, I can also save all my memories and precious photos on my online cloud system I mentioned (Backblaze), or with a service like Google Photos, so I can have piece of mind that if anything happens to my house, or my computer system, that all my data is backed up and available whenever I need it, wherever I am. With further advances in the cloud computing space, software and data centres will continue to drop in price, saving me and other consumers even more money.
