      <center> <h1>Machine Learning</h1> </center>

    <p style="font-family:Arial"> 
        <b>What does it do?</b> <br>
        <br>
Machine Learning is a way that systems can automatically learn and adapt from the situations and experiences that they have been involved in. Essentially machine learning (ML) is programming a computer so it can learn from data and adapt from the information it has been given. Machine learning is a subcategory of Artificial Intelligence (AI). A good example of machine learning is smart speakers, such as Google’s Home system, and Amazons’ Alexa. Whenever you ask these smart speakers a question, they use machine learning to figure out habits and asking patterns, and they can also search google for answers to your question, which they can add into their own systems. Another amazing thing that can be done currently by the powers of machine learning is fraud detection. There are various forms that are seen of this, an example being the ReCaptcha system. This system asks the user to click on images of certain things, and it can tell when it is a computer or system fraudulently trying to login by the way the cursor is moved, and the actions that are taken by the user. It uses machine learning to upgrade itself for the better all the time, so that no computer system is able to beat it. Another common example of machine learning for fraud detection is PayPal. PayPal uses machine learning to compare your purchase history and the history of everyone using the system to tell if the purchase that was just made is fraudulent or not, therefore protecting both consumers and their own business against money laundering, scams and the like. In the next couple of years we are likely to see immense improvements in this world of machine learning. One of these, in my opinion, is fully autonomous (self-driving) vehicles. Machine learning and AI in the last 5 years have been able to make a computer’s ‘vision’ more accurate than a human already, which means that in another few years, they will be absolutely mind blowing! This means that using machine learning, different car companies will be making self-driving cars which improve based on the driving habits of humans, and constantly are improving and updating with new situations. One big thing that makes this type of technology possible is the advancements that have been made, and will continue to be made, in the field of processors. Machine learning systems need very powerful processors to run, and learn, hence why this is definitely a massive development that has been made, and will continue to be refined.<br>
        <br>
 
        <b>What is the likely impact?</b><br>
        <br>
Machine Learning will be, and has already impacted many areas of life. A good example of the impact of machine learning is shown with autonomous vehicles. Specifically at the moment, this is how Tesla is doing so well with their cars and software. These cars use machine learning and take all the data from the million cars that Tesla has on roads that people have purchased, and uses that data to improve its full self-driving capabilities. Because of this machine learning, these AI powered cars have now surpassed regular human-driven cars in terms of safety ratings. Machine learning allows the car to adapt to new road situations, and a computers processing time is much shorter than a human is, meaning that they can make split-second decisions faster than any driver on earth. A lot of different jobs in a lot of different fields will be taken over by computers with machine learning. A few good categories of job losses that will be shown are dangerous jobs, such as bomb disposal, and welding. With bomb disposal, although the currently trained people doing this job will be made redundant, it will mean that there is no possibility of losing a human life due to the bomb going off. These tasks are, on occasion, already happening, but in the very near future we will see machine learning and artificial intelligence take over this more and more. This will, however, create more jobs in the field of manufacturing.<br>
        <br>
        
        <b>How will this affect you?</b><br>
        <br>
In day to day life for my family, friends and I, machine learning will significantly affect our daily lives. One of the best things that I like for my friends, and especially family, is safety and security. I know that with the advancements in AI and machine learning, this will be a big thing. Kaspersky, for example, uses AI and machine learning in their Anti-Virus software to tell if files are malicious – even if they’re different than any other file! Another big safety issue is at public venues, events, or flights. At the moment, we are having to screen people manually for illegal or dangerous weapons. With machine learning, in the very near future, it is likely that we will see this process become automated by machines, which will weed out the human error side of it, therefore being a lot more accurate. Another big effect for myself personally is on the side of AI and machine learning in cars. This is a massive thing for myself, as I actually own a Tesla, which is the most advanced self-driving car in the world, and it uses all the feeds of every Tesla in the world to be more accurate and precise with it’s choices of when to drive, stop, steer, accelerate and brake. My car will drive itself to my destination, and it has already been proven countless times over that self-driving cars are a LOT safer than human-driven cars. I have seen this firsthand, where my car has detected that there would be an accident before I would have if I were driving, and it braked and avoided the crash.
