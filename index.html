        <p style=font-family:"Arial"> <b>Zaidyn</b> - My name is Zaidyn Melrose. My Student Number is s3866949. My Email address is s3866949@student.rmit.edu.au. I was born near Sydney, Australia. I have lived in the suburbs my entire life. I completed Year 10 and commenced a Tafe Course, but due to personal reasons regarding my place of living, was never able to complete it. I have had two long term dreams. The first was to work at Google. Iâ€™ve been saying that ever since I could talk! The other is to own a Tesla, which I have just accomplished a few weeks ago. I also have two guinea pigs, named Melody and Harmony, who are adorable. I love animals and am passionate about animal welfare.
