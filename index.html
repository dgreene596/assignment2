         <h2>Zaidyn</h2> <p style=font-family:"Arial"> - My name is Zaidyn Melrose. My Student Number is s3866949. My Email address is s3866949@student.rmit.edu.au. I was born near Sydney, Australia. I have lived in the suburbs my entire life. I completed Year 10 and commenced a Tafe Course, but due to personal reasons regarding my place of living, was never able to complete it. I have had two long term dreams. The first was to work at Google. Iâ€™ve been saying that ever since I could talk! The other is to own a Tesla, which i'm getting in less than two weeks (29/6). I also have two guinea pigs, named Melody and Harmony, who are adorable. I love animals and am passionate about animal welfare.

- ENTP is one of the 16 different personality types identified by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. People with this personality type are often described as innovative, clever, and expressive. Psychologist David Keirsey, creator of the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, suggests that ENTPs account for approximately two to five percent of all people.<br>
The MBTI analyses personality in four key dimensions: 1) Extraversion and Introversion, 2) Sensing and Intuition, 3) Thinking and Feeling and 4) Perceiving and Judging. As you have probably already realized, the acronym ENTP stands for Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Perceiving.<br>

Spontaneous, Versatile, Acquisitive, and Scattered For more about the meaning of the arrows, see below.<br>
<br>
Sevens are extroverted, optimistic, versatile, and spontaneous. Playful, high-spirited, and practical, they can also misapply their many talents, becoming over- extended, scattered, and undisciplined. They constantly seek new and exciting experiences, but can become distracted and exhausted by staying on the go. They typically have problems with impatience and impulsiveness. At their Best: they focus their talents on worthwhile goals, becoming appreciative, joyous, and satisfied.
