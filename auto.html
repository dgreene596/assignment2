        <p style="font-family:Arial"> <b>What does it do?</b>
            <br>
            <br>
Autonomous vehicles are definitely the way of the future. For the purposes of this area, I will be mainly talking about the leader in this space at the moment, Tesla, for several reasons. Tesla has several different systems, called Enhanced Autopilot (EAP) and Full Self Driving (FSD). Enhanced Autopilot is the free software that comes with all cars, while Full Self Driving is just what the name says – it drives itself. This does cost extra, but is well worth the investment because of what it does. To put it in perspective, Tesla’s Full Self Driving system has achieved over six billion kilometres! The closest competitor is a company named Waymo, who has just thirty million kilometres driven. Owning a Tesla car myself, with Full Self Driving, as well as a Tesla fanatic and investor, I see firsthand just how crazy and futuristic this technology is. My car can drive itself on the highways, multi-lane roads with lines, as well as some city streets. It will brake, accelerate and steer for me. It really is a sight to see. Tesla also claims that its cars can drive themselves on pretty much all roads, although they are held back by legislation. This means that in the very near future, probably within the next year, we will see this changed and the cars will be able to drive themselves everywhere. Following this change, and a few more legislation changes, Tesla will also be changing their business model, to better reflect their future in the automotive industry. They will likely not be selling cars to consumers anymore; they will transition to a business model in which car and fleet owners can let the cars drive other people around for profit while not in use. They are calling this their Robotaxi network. Think of it like Uber, but without drivers. Tesla has been refining their Full Self Driving system for years and years, and are roughly six years ahead of every other brand. Tesla’s data lead is unmatched. Tesla’s software is unmatched. Tesla’s customer service and satisfaction is unmatched. Tesla’s production costs, revenue and profit are unmatched, and Tesla’s market cap is unmatched. All of this combined means that Tesla has all the developments needed to make autonomous driving possible. One of the only things that they might be able to improve on is gathering more data, further refining their Full Self Driving and Enhanced Autopilot systems.

            <b>What is the likely impact?</b>
            <br>
            <br>
The impact that this Robotaxi network that Tesla will create is going to be massive, there’s no doubt about it. Why would a person take a Taxi, or an Uber, when a ride from the Robotaxi Tesla fleet is both way cheaper, and a lot safer. Self-driving cars have already proven to be safer than human drivers, by over ten times. A flow on effect will happen, where most Uber and Taxi drivers will lose their income stream, and because of that, most people at the company offices for these companies will be made redundant. A further likely impact of this technology is that traditional automakers will suffer – why would someone buy a car? With the business model that Tesla is planning, it will work out cheaper to just get a ride from a car on the Robotaxi network every time you need one, rather than owning a car and paying related expenses. Traditional automakers are absolute years behind Tesla, and will severely struggle to catch up, causing a lot of layoffs in the future from these other automakers, reduced profits, and a lot of income for Tesla. Tesla is highly likely to be the next trillion-dollar company, and the most valuable company in the world. For Tesla investors, such as myself, this also means great profits, helping people to retire early and build up their net worth. This will however develop new jobs inside Tesla, although not nearly as many jobs will be made as the ones lost.

            <b>How will this affect you?</b>
            <br>
            <br>
 This will affect me in a positive way. This is because I already own one of these cars that is compatible with the Self Driving Network that Tesla is making. When the Robotaxi fleet gets rolled out, I will be able to send my car off to make passive money for me while I am at work. Conservative estimates mean that I will earn around $25,000 per year after all expenses paid (electricity, insurance) just by letting my car drive people around when I do not require it. This will pay for my car purchase in itself quite quickly. I will continue to be able to use my car when I need to, but I will not have a car that is sitting in my driveway for hours on end, as it is currently. It will be driving other people around earning passive revenue. For my family and friends, I can see it being a feature where I can give discounted or free rides in the car in the future once the network is running. I would be able to let them use my car when needed, and just charge for running costs or not charge at all. For my family and friends, the autonomous vehicle space could completely transform their lives. Several of my friends don’t currently own cars, so they wouldn’t have to spend the crazy prices buying one, and would be able to use the Robotaxi network to make their lives cheaper. For my family, my Grandfather can’t drive anymore because of his old age so it would mean he would be still able to get around.
