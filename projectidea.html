    <center><h3 style=font-family:"Arial">The App Organiser</h3></center><br>

<p style=font-family:"Arial">

The App Organiser is a brand-new app designed to work only on android devices. The application will allow the users to be able to quickly and easily rearrange their applications via a single tap or gesture to the desired organisational settings. This project will enable users to be able to quickly clear the clutter from their home screens and within their app drawer by organising them into name colour or type of application for the user and maintaining the structure of pre-determined user organisational preferences.<br>
<br>
When getting a new smartphone or just moving to a different phone everyday end-users such as myself face the dilemma of having to organise new applications on their smartphone into name, colour or category order to cleanse their OCD. It quickly becomes a very tedious process having to short hold, drag and drop apps into each folder or section over and over again. Sometimes your phone can update, throwing away all of your hard work causing you to have to repeat the organisational process from the beginning and this can easily become quite a frustrating task.<br>
<br>
The App Organiser will be a free downloadable app from the Play Store users will be able to download directly to their smartphones. Upon installation, the user will be asked how they like to have their apps in the app drawer and on their home screen organised with the ability to select from varied customisation options such as colour, application class and name and whether they will be in folders or grouped in herds or a mixture of both. After choosing the preferred organisation method, these settings will be saved and remembered before taking the user to an interface showing all the selected options and the option to start the organisation schedule which if selected will organise the applications are per the pre-defined settings. The app will contain an auto-check feature which can be customised to suit the users' needs where it will be able to identify if any new applications have been installed and organise them according to the selected organisational settings. When the app runs its check cycle, it will notify the user if specific apps haven't been used in a pre-determined set of time classing them as possible junk apps with the option to customise this amount of time before it flags the app under this category. An opportunity to remove these apps or whitelist them from future checks will be given for the user to make the decision. The app will contain a feedback button where users will be able to suggest improvements and different organisation suggestions to implement.<br>
<br>
To be able to create the base application, Andracheck (2013)  recommended the Android Software Development Kit and SDK Manager are base requirements, and if using a Windows computer Cygwin is also necessary. Having a powerful PC and more than one monitor would benefit the creation process so everything is not all cluttered. There are applications such as Ruby, Xamarin 2.0 or B4X/A which can also be used to develop the application itself depending on the complexity of actions it will be required to complete.<br>
<br>
To bring the app to life, you'll need to be very familiar with android app development with any of the programming languages such as Java, C, C++, Basic or Kotlin as suggested by Sinicki (2019). A deep understanding on how the app will need to communicate with the Android OS to make the app work how it's designed to work. The tools to create this app are easily obtainable and free, finding a programmer familiar with android app development may be difficult but posting a freelance job shouldn't make it too difficult to find the right person.<br>
<br>
To fund this project we would look at creating a kick starter alongside an online social media campaign to gauge and generate interest in the product before moving into full team production and investing funds into it.<br>
If the kick starter were to be unsuccessful, it would turn into a spare time indie development project in which it would be worked on by the team outside of working hours using all the free accesible android development platforms and learning material which are readily available for use and consumption online.<br>
    <br>
If the project were to be successfully created with the outlined features above, every day users would have an app they can install to easily organise and maintain the rest of their applications apps without having to worry about manually moving their apps around and deciding how they want them to be organised. Any changes of mind will be quickly resolved by updating the preferences and hitting and initiating the organise feature.<br>
